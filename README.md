nREPL is a Clojure *n*etwork REPL that
provides a REPL server and client, along with some common APIs
of use to IDEs and other tools that may need to evaluate Clojure
code in remote environments.

### How is this different from the "contrib" [tools.nrepl](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl/) project?

Check the brief history of nREPL, available
[here](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/about/history.html).

### Status

Extremely stable. nREPL's protocol and API are rock-solid and battle
tested. nREPL's team pledges to evolve them only in
backwards-compatible ways.

That being said, there were a few organizational changes related to
the transition out of clojure-contrib that everyone has to keep in
mind:

* `[nrepl "0.3.1"]` is a drop-in replacement for
  `[org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.13"]` (notice the different artifact coordinates).
* `[nrepl "0.4.0"]` changes the namespaces from `clojure.tools.nrepl.*` to
`nrepl.*`.

A later `1.0.0` release will include fixes for all previously-reported
but languishing nREPL issues. Future releases will focus on supporting
the needs of the essential tools of the Clojure(Script) ecosystem
(e.g. Leiningen, Boot, CIDER, Cursive).

## Usage

See the [manual](https://nrepl.org).
