= Beyond Clojure

As mentioned earlier the nREPL protocol is language-agnostic and can
be leveraged for many languages that have the ability to evaluate code
at runtime.

Note than certain clients may make Clojure-specific assumptions which
will cause bugs when used with other servers while other clients are
designed with language-agnosticism in mind.
